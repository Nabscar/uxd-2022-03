						<h2>Phase 2 Report Out</h2>
						<p>
							Receipt Tracking for People, centered on Freelancers and Content Creators
						</p>
					</header>

					<p>
						<h3>Overview of the Phase</h3>
						<br>
							The goal of the phase was to understand our people group and design a solution for their financing and taxing needs. The report of this phase includes the people 
							group we are designing for, the main problem we indefntified that we planned on solving, some low fidelity protoypes, and the design choices we made to get to our 
							final prototype for this phase.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>What is the idea?</h3>
						<br>
							uTax is a taxing and finacing website that serves small businesses in the United States. Rather than collecting perosnal data, our solution aims to provide general tips 
							and information about the prcoess of filing for taxes. The main gap we indentified among small business owners is that they fall in the space between starting to pay taxes 
							as a company, and large companies hiring accountants. uTax aims to teach our users how to navitage the process so everyone has the freedom to file their own taxes.

					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Prior Research</h3>
						<br>
							<b>The Problem</b> - The main problem we started to work towards was the hassle and the stigma around the taxing in the United States. As all inviduals who had been through the 
							process, we wanted to design something that helped make the process simpler in some capacity. Some of the factors that we had to think about was invovling privacy and 
							data collection. The fact that we were thinkinig of entering the film of finances, we had to answer some questions about if we were planning on collecting data, 
							and if yes, how were we planning on handling it. Throughout our design process, we have tried incooperating these questions.
							<br>
							<br>

							<b>User Group</b> - During our research phase, we found that large corportate companies hire accounting firms to manage their finances and taxes. Individuals, who are on the other 
							side of the spectrum, have access to personal financing applications such as Mint and Nerwallet. The group we found that was missing a solution that was personalised for them 
							and were in need of a solution were self-employed people, and small business owners. In order to scope the project more, we decided to focus on the United States.

						<h3>Personas</h3>

						<h3>Portfolio of Design Ideas</h3>
							For out portfolio of design ideas, we took the 100 ideas approach, where each of us took 10 minutes to create 20 ideas of what out product could look like and then we sat together 
							and grouped them. The grouping was of ideas that were similar, and then sorted them into 3 categories, from ground to blue sky, where ground is extremely doable, and blue sky 
							is extremely hopeful/out of scope completely. Below you can see our grouped and sorted 100 ideas.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>INSERT 100 IDEAS</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Sketches of 3 Plausible Ideas</h3>
						<br>
							After we had done the 100 ideas, we chose 3 of them *Receipt Reader/Scanner, Tax Reminders, and Privacy and Security) and started to sketch, based on these ideas, what our product 
							might look like. Each of us did a sketch which you can see below. The reason why we went with these three were because of the scope of the class and the amount of time we wanted 
							to commit to the project. We aimed to start with an idea that we could build a quick prototype off and then iterate over the weeks. One of our main learning goals as a team was 
							to go through the process and understand the value of all of them, rather than just focusing on the product itself.
							<br>
							<br>

						<b>INSERT GALLERY Sketches</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Identify one approach to pursue</h3>
						<br>
							After this, we took our sketches and centered on one single approach to pursue, combining ideas we saw in the different sketches to make something we were happy with. Below 
							is a blurb explaining our thinking at this point and sketches for the sign-up and newsletter we decided to start with. We think the biggest problem with taxes is how 
							confusing they are, and how hard it is for people to understand them. Because of that, we believe the initial point for our product should be a introductory form where 
							we get general information from our user and have a newsletter that de-mystifies taxes and how they work for our user. Thus, our first idea is this form and the corresponding 
							newsletter that our users would begin with.
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Storyboard/Interaction Flow</h3>
						<br>
							At the same time we were working on the one approach to pursue, we did an interaction flow/storyboard of what our users would go through when the entered our platform. 
							Pink post-its are buttons, and light blue post-its are pages. You can see this story board below.
							<br>
							<br>

							<b>INSERT STORYBOARD/INTERACTION</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						<h3>Low-fidelity Paper Prototype</h3>
						<br>
							Having done all of this, we needed a paper prototype so we could start testing what our users thought about our project, below you can see 6 frames of a paper prototype 
							that takes the user through the interaction our product has.
